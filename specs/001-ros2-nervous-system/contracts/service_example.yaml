# Service Contract: Add Two Ints Example

## Overview
This contract defines the interface for the "Add Two Ints" service example that demonstrates ROS 2 service-based communication.

## Service Server Node: `service_server`

### Interface
- **Node Name**: `service_server`
- **Provided Services**:
  - `/add_two_ints` (type: `example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts`)

### Request Format
```yaml
a: int64  # First integer to add
b: int64  # Second integer to add
```

### Response Format
```yaml
sum: int64  # The sum of a and b
```

### Behavior
- Waits for service requests on `/add_two_ints`
- Computes the sum of the two input integers
- Returns the result to the client
- Continues running until node is shut down

## Service Client Node: `service_client`

### Interface
- **Node Name**: `service_client`
- **Service Clients**:
  - `/add_two_ints` (type: `example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts`)

### Request Format
```yaml
a: int64  # First integer to add
b: int64  # Second integer to add
```

### Response Format
```yaml
sum: int64  # The sum of a and b
```

### Behavior
- Calls the `/add_two_ints` service with sample values
- Waits for and receives the response
- Logs the result to console
- Continues running until node is shut down

## Service Contract
- **Service Name**: `/add_two_ints`
- **Service Type**: `example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts`
- **Communication Pattern**: One-to-one (client to server)

## Expected Behavior
When both nodes are running:
1. Client node sends a request to add two integers (e.g., 2 + 3)
2. Server node receives the request and computes the sum
3. Server node sends the result back to the client
4. Client node receives and logs the result (e.g., "Sum: 5")
