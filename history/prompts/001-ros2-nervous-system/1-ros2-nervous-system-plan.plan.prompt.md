# Response

Implementation plan created for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). The plan includes:

- Updated Technical Context with ROS 2 Humble, Python, Jetson Orin Nano focus
- Constitution Check with full compliance verification
- Research document covering core concepts, language choice, hardware platform, simulation vs real hardware, lab exercise, security, and performance considerations
- Data model describing ROS 2 Node, Topic, Service, and URDF entities
- API contracts for publisher/subscriber and service examples
- Quickstart guide with complete setup and example code

All artifacts are compliant with the project constitution emphasizing embodied intelligence and sim-to-real transfer capabilities.
